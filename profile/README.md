## For students

Current & past students can join our slack workspace [ITESO - Data Science & Engineering](https://rhdzmota-iteso.slack.com/) by using their official university email. You can also send a "join" request with your personal email.

FAQ:

**Why should I join the slack workspace?** If you are a current student, weâ€™ll be using a private channel in Slack as our main communication channel for official announcement. Moreover, complementary course information and job opportunities will continue to be shared by your professor on the public channels even after course termination. Users (students) will not be removed by the end of semester, although, you can opt-out by deleting your account at any time.

**Are there any other benefits on joining the slack workspace, even as a previous student?** Yes. As mentioned before, your professor will continue to publish complementary information and job opportunities on Slack. Furthermore, dependending on the cross-collaboration strategy with your university, there might be additional benefits:

- [ITESO-Industry Strategic Collaboration](https://rhdzmota.com/404) (in progress)
- [ITESO-Saturdays.AI GDL Collaboration](https://rhdzmota.com/404) (in progress)
